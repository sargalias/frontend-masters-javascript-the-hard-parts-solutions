# Frontend Masters - JavaScript - The Hard Parts - Solutions

My solutions to the exercises in the course by [Frontend Masters - JavaScript - The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/).

They are extremely simple, having just the JavaScript files and a simple HTML file to be able to see the console.log statements in the console. Nothing fancy except the solutions.

## Source of the challenges

1. Callbacks and higher-order functions - http://csbin.io/callbacks
2. Closures, scope and execution context - http://csbin.io/closures
3. Asynchronicity - http://csbin.io/async
4. Object-oriented JavaScript - http://csbin.io/oop

## Running the code

- Easiest way is probably to run the code in each file in your IDE.
  - E.g. with VSCode, install the [Code runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) extension, then use it to run the code in each file.
- Alternatively open the `index.html` file in a browser, then open the console to see the output.
